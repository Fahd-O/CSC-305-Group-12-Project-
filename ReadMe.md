## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the CSC 305 (Web Programming) course during the **3rd year, 1st semester** of our Computer Science program at the **Federal University Oye-Ekiti (FUOYE)**. The task was assigned to a group of **10 members** to collaboratively design and implement a web-based platform for managing thrift/cooperative society operations.

The project aimed to apply practical knowledge of **web programming technologies** to solve a real-world problem in financial and resource management within small cooperative groups or societies.
